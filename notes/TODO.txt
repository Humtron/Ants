TODO:

Only allow workers to move into tile if workers exceed other ants in tile...
	If player moves 3 workers into tile with 4 other ants already, no move is possible
	If player moves 5 workers into tile with 4 other ants, move occurs, and yield is split proportionally
	... this allows choke points, and encourages ant swarms
