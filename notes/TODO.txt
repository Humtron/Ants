TODO:

Move food in tile to upper right as an overlay
Remove ant icon from tiles
Make huge worker icon in tile as draggable (and use class swap)
Show fractional values on tiles for active player (1/3 meaning player has 1 ant, out of 3 on tile)

Only allow workers to move into tile if workers exceed other ants in tile...
	If player moves 3 workers into tile with 4 other ants already, no move is possible
	If player moves 5 workers into tile with 4 other ants, move occurs, and yield is split proportionally
	... this allows chokepoints, and encourages ant swarms

Make board round. South tiles can move onto north tiles, and vice versa.
