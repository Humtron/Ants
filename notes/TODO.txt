TODO:

Make board round. South tiles can move onto north tiles, and vice versa. This will mean all columns have identical numbers of tiles?

Randomly eliminate single tiles to create a more dynamic board
	No tiles from first column
	No tiles from first tiles in column, or last tile in column

Refigure game board to be generated one column at a time... columns unlock every few rounds
Each tile should understand which tiles are adjacent, and which tiles it can accept moves from (unless inactive)
	For given tile number X in column number Y, adjacent tiles can be determined as:
		Same column: X +- 1
		Left column: X - (3 * number of players)
					 X - (3 * number of players) - 1
		Rght column: X + (3 * number of players)
					 X + (3 * number of players) - 1
