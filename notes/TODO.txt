TODO:

Make board round. South tiles can move onto north tiles, and vice versa. This will mean all columns have identical numbers of tiles?

Make yield and upkeep assess immediately after player turn, to prevent nasty surprises.

Randomly eliminate single tiles to create a more dynamic board
	No tiles from first column
	No tiles from first tiles in column, or last tile in column

Create a mesh of possible tile positions... and then fill these with active/inactive tiles
Refigure game board to be random... generated one column at a time... columns unlock every few rounds
Each tile should understand which tiles are adjacent, and which tiles it can accept moves from
	For given tile number X in column number Y, adjacent tiles can be determined as:
		Same column: X +- 1
		Left column: X - (3 * number of players)
					 X - (3 * number of players) - 1
		Rght column: X + (3 * number of players)
					 X + (3 * number of players) - 1
