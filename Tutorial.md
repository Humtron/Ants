# How to play Ant Swarm

## Creating a new game

First, choose the number of players. Click the button to create a game.

You'll be able to enter names for all of the players. If you decide not to name a player, the system will use a placeholder name.

You can also customize the game settings. Click "show advanced settings" to see the various possibilities, and hold your mouse over a setting to see a tooltip explanation. Some of these settings could cause strange/unexpected behavior if pushed to extremesâ€¦ for example, if every player hill starts with 3 million workers, the player hill is not large enough to display all the text. Exercise restraint.

## Playing your turn

Each player will take turns sequentially. Once all players have had a turn, the round ends, and the next round begins with the first player's turn again. During your turn, you'll "hatch" and "swarm" ants to maximize your yield. Yield (how much food is gathered from tiles by your workers) and upkeep (how much it costs to feed your queens and workers) are assessed at the end of your turn.

### Hatching ants

At any time during your turn, you may hatch queens and workers. Hatched ants will immediately appear in your hill.

Queens never leave the hill. Queens are the lifeblood of your ants. You must always have at least one queen, or your game is over. The only way to lose queens is through starvation (upkeep exceeds yield and all food is depleted). Queens are also important because they hatch "broods" of workers. Because brood cost is a flat rate, having more queens linearly reduces the unit cost of hatching workers.

Workers in your hill cost upkeep, but gather no yield. Swarm your workers to the tiles near your hill to start gathering yield each turn. Workers in a tile gather yield proportional to the percentage of your workers in the tile versus all workers in the tile. For example, if a tile can yield 10 food, and you have 1 worker in the tile, you have 1 worker out of 1 total worker(s), and you'll get 100% of the 10 yield.  If player 1 has 3 ants in the tile, and player 2 has 5 ants there, player 1 will receive 3/8 of the total possible yield.

To swarm workers to a tile, just drag the worker icon from the hill (or tile) to a different tile. As you drag, the valid moves for the worker will show on the board.  Let go to drop the workers onto the tile.  A window will help you decide how many workers to swarm.

The game settings govern how many swarms you can make per turn. It doesn't matter how many workers swarm, or where you move them. The only limit is how many swarms you can make each turn.

### Viewing the demographics of a tile

Click on a tile to see the demographics of the tile. Any players with workers in the tile will be displayed, along with their respective yield from the tile.

### Tracking the score

Click the "score" link on the top of the page. The scoreboard shows each player, their last yield, next yield and upkeep.

### Starvation

In the event that your upkeep exceeds your yield at the end of your turn, the difference is removed from the stockpile of food in your hill.

If you no longer have any food in your hill, workers begin to die off, starting with the workers farthest from the hill (i.e., in the farthest tiles).

If all your workers are dead, and there is still starvation, your queens will die.

If all of your queens die, your game is over, and the other players will continue without you. Your turn will simply be skipped.

## The goal of the game

At the moment, the only goal is to avoid starvation. Manage your growth to avoid overextending your ants.
